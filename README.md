# AutoDoc-AI-Powered-Project-Report-Generator
AutoDoc is an intelligent tool that automatically generates comprehensive project reports based on user-provided topics. AutoDoc streamlines the report-writing process by producing clean, structured, and detailed documents including abstracts, introductions, problem statements, literature surveys, conclusions, and even graphs.

Features

- Generate detailed project reports with minimal user input.
- Supports multiple sections including Abstract, Introduction, Problem Statement, Literature Survey, Conclusion, and Graphs.
- Utilizes cutting-edge pre-trained language models to understand and expand on user topics.
- Provides clean, readable, and professional report output.
- Easily customizable to fit specific project or academic requirements.

## How It Works

AutoDoc accepts a topic from the user and sends the input to a powerful language model backend. The AI interprets the topic, applies natural language understanding, and generates coherent text for each report section. The system ensures that the generated content is relevant, informative, and structured.

## Technologies Used

- Pre-trained large language models (e.g., GPT-based)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Python (or your implementation language)
- APIs for AI model integration
